# Metrolink-Journey-Planner
A Level Computer Science NEA Project - a basic journey planner for the Manchester Metrolink network.
This is currently a work in progress. The finished project will allow a user to enter two tram stops and find the shortest route between them, including three different modes - "leave now", "depart at" and "arrive by". This project will make use of the TfGM open data API. The project will also include an interactive tram map showing the next trams departing from each station, and a fare calculator.
